As we discussed, let’s try $8500 on Apple. Hopefully, that’s OK. -Brooke

Edward, can you do $50 thousand to Infotech Inc. and another $10,000 with Amazon? Also, let’s try just $5000 for Newcorp stock. Call me if you have any questions.

I’ve finally decided on $11,200 with Microsoft. Always liked Windows.
